Ory is the largest open source community in the world for application security.
We maintain advanced open source security software solving authentication,
authorization, access control, application network security, and delegation.
Ory implements a variety of best-practice standards including OAuth 2.0 / OAuth 2.1,
OpenID Connect, Zero Trust Networking, Zanzibar Policy Framework, FIDO2 U2F, WebAuthn,
TOTP, and many, many more.

- [Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos) is a fully customizable, API-only
 platform for login, two-factor authentication, social sign in, passwordless
 flows, registration, account recovery, email / phone verification, identity
 and user management.
- [Ory Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra) is an API-only OAuth 2.0 and OpenID
 Connect provider that can interface with any identity and user management
 system (e.g. Ory Kratos, Firebase, your PHP app, LDAP, SAML ...).
- [Ory Oathkeeper](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper) is a zero trust networking
 proxy and sidecar for popular ingress services and API gateways. It checks if
 incoming network request are authenticated and allowed to perform the
 requested action.
- [Ory Keto](https://github.com/ory/keto) is the world's first implementation of
 [Google's Zanzibar](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/) research paper, an
 infinitely scalable and blazing fast authorization and permission service.
 Think RBAC on globally distributed steroids.
